## Profile
My name is M. Nolan Gray. (My first name is Matthew, but if you said "Hi, Matthew" on the street, I probably wouldn't respond!) I'm a PhD student in city planning here at the Luskin School. My research focuses on urban land-use regulation. You may have seen some of my writing around the [Internet!](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUpPrQITJ9E/nolan-gray)

## Project Ideas
I'm still wrapping my head around what's possible with urban data science, but one question I have is whether land use in unzoned Houston behaves systematically different than land use in zoned peer cities, like Dallas or San Antonio. Do uses like industry and multifamily housing basically behave the same? Or not? This could help to shed some on the impact of zoning.

## Objectives for the Class
I love mapping and playing around with spatial data. I already have some background in GIS, so I would like to accomplish two main in this course:
* Liberate myself from the shackles of ESRI by learning how to map with open source tools
* Learn how to use coding to up my mapping and data analysis gameâ€”no more pointing and clicking
