## Profile
My name is M. Nolan Gray. (My first name is Matthew, but if you said "Hi, Matthew" on the street, I probably wouldn't respond!) I'm a PhD student in city planning here at the Luskin School. My research focuses on urban land-use regulation. To get a sense for my work, check out this [big paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0739456X20935156) I recently published on lot size reform in Houson.

I was previously a professional city planner in New York City. I also do a lot of writing on cities. You may have seen some of my work on [Citylab](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUpPrQITJ9E/nolan-gray) or [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/nolan-gray/). I have lived and worked in DC, Guatemala City, and New Jersey, and I'm originally from Lexington, Kentucky.

## Project Ideas
I'm still wrapping my head around what's possible with urban data science, but one question I have is whether land use in unzoned Houston behaves systematically different than land use in zoned peer cities, like Dallas or San Antonio. Do uses like industry and multifamily housing basically behave the same? Or not? This could help to shed some on the impact of zoning.

## Objectives for the Class
I love mapping and playing around with spatial data. I already have some background in GIS, so I would like to accomplish two main in this course:
* Liberate myself from the shackles of ESRI by learning how to map with open source tools
* Learn how to use coding to up my mapping and data analysis gameâ€”no more pointing and clicking
