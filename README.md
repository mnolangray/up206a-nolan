My name is M. Nolan Gray. (My first name is Matthew, but if you said "Hi, Matthew" on the street, I probably wouldn't respond!) I'm a PhD student in city planning here at the Luskin School. My research focuses on urban land-use regulation. You may have seen some of my writing around the [Internet!](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUpPrQITJ9E/nolan-gray)
