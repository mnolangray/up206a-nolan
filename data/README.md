## Week 1: Data
These are shapefiles from LADOT mapping the location of Overnight Parking Districts ([source](https://data.lacity.org/Transportation/LADOT-Overnight-Parking-Districts/jk9n-burj)) and Preferential Parking Districts ([source](https://data.lacity.org/Transportation/LADOT-Preferential-Parking-Districts-PPD-/2ckn-xmjp)). These are mapped largely to exclude vehicle dwellers from certain portions of the city. 

I would like to combine this with Census tract data to explore which demographic and economic factors are associated with exclusionary parking policies, to be informed by council files and news coverage on the adoption of each.
