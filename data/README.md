## Week 1: Data
These are shapefiles from LADOT mapping the location of Overnight Parking Districts [source](https://data.lacity.org/Transportation/LADOT-Overnight-Parking-Districts/jk9n-burj) and Preferential Parking Districts [source](https://data.lacity.org/Transportation/LADOT-Preferential-Parking-Districts-PPD-/2ckn-xmjp). These are mapped largely to exclude vehicle dwellers from certain portions of the city.
